# Neon Helium Tutorial

This is a port of the 'Neon Helium' tutorial to the [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) build system.

I could not find much online about how to use OpenGL with Maven so I wanted to publish this in case others might find it useful. The Nehe tutorials are also a good test to make sure that JOGL is probably packaged for Maven.

## Acknowledgements

This distribution of the NeHe tutorials is of course primarily the hard work of others.

The original tutorials where made for [GameDev.net](http://nehe.gamedev.net/).

Original C++ source code by Jeff Molofee with contributions from Fredric Echols.

Java ports by Darren Hodges and Jeff Kirby.
